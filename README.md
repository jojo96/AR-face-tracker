# Ar-face-tracker
An AR face tracker built using javascript. The helmet one is an inbuilt one. The rest are implemented by me. Check out live demo at: https://jojo96.github.io/Ar-face-tracker/

## Local Setup:
 If you run the project locally:
 
 1. Download the repository
 
 2. In the command line, cd to downloaded folder(for example, I just downloaded the zip file in the downloaded folder and extracted it there, So, in the command line, I would type cd C:\Users\Jojo\Downloads\Ar-face-tracker-master. Then type the command in step 3)
 
 3. zapworks serve .

 4. Go to browser and type: https://127.0.0.1:8080 
 
 The above process would work, assuming you have zapworks cli. If you don't, check out https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zappar/zapworks-cli
